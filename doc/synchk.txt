2.Synchk Usage					*synchk-usage* {{{1

	The synchk.vim plugin helps syntax highlighting plugin writers to
	maintain their syntax highlighting plugin.  Typical use involves
	manually inspecting a test file to insure that its being highlighted
	correctly; once that is so, run |:MakeSynChk| on it.  This operation
	will save information on the current syntax highlighting;
	subsequently, one may run |:SynChk| to verify that the highlighting
	has not changed.

	Typically, one has a test directory wherein are a number of files that
	exercise various aspects of syntax highlighting.  After one is
	satisfied that the syntax highlighting is correct, run >

		:MakeSynChk
<	
	on the current file.  This operation will create a "synchk/" directory
	if it doesn't already exist, and will create a
	"filename_suffix.synchk" file.   

	Assume that one then changes the syntax highlighting plugin; to verify
	that highlighting has not changed in a previously :SynChk'd file, run >

		:SynChk
<
	You may then have to type |:messages| to see the status.

	One may also use the "many-file" variants of these two commands: >

		:ManyMakeSynChk filename(s)
		:ManySynChk filename(s)
<
	Method Used:~

	The |:MakeSynChk| command computes a hash value for each line in the
	current file, saving it to synchk/file_suffix.synchk.  The hash
	involves synIDattr(synID(line("."),col("."),1),"name"); this is
	(see |synIDattr|, |synID|, |line()|, and |col()|)
	the name of the syntax item under the cursor.  The syntax name of
	each character in a line are converted to numbers and hashed together.
	Every line of the current file is thus converted into a hashed value;
	the hashed value is saved.

	Similarly, the |:SynChk| command also computes hash values for every
	line in the current file; however, instead of saving the hashed value,
	it compares it to the previously saved hash value.  If the two differ,
	then syntax highlighting is considered to have failed.

	Thus, |:Synchk| is sensitive to syntax highlighting changes on a
	line by line basis, and can be used to locate unexpected changes in
	syntax highlighting.  Of course, "failures" may be intentional.

	Just run |:MakeSynChk| again when one is satisfied that the current
	file is being highlighted correctly.

3.Synchk Manual					*synchk-manual*  {{{1

MakeSynChk					*:MakeSynChk*

	Makes a synchk/testfile_suffix.synchk file out of the current file.

ManyMakeSynChk					*:ManyMakeSynChk*

	Runs |:MakeSynChk| using a list of files, which may include wildcards.

SynChk						*:SynChk*

	Runs synchk on the current file.
	Returns 1=passed, 0=failed (changed).
	Also displays a message, via |echomsg|, either:

		testfile.suffix passed
		testfile.suffix failed

ManySynChk					*:ManySynChk*

	Runs |:SynChk| on supplied list of files, which may include wildcards.

4.Synchk History				*synchk-history* {{{1

Dec 14, 2012	v1	* initial
May 29, 2013		* (Bram Moolenaar) pointed out three problems, which
			  are now fixed:

			    In s:SynChkHash(), the hash local variable must
			    always be set to zero

			    The MakeSynChk() takes a range, but the range
			    needed to start with the first line in the file.
			    This should no longer be the case (the synchktab
			    file will be padded with blank lines).

			    In s:SynCHkHash(), the check for col('.') >= col('$')
			    is unreliable (changed to use virtcol() instead).
